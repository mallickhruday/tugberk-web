## TODO

Idea is to replicate what I current have and then build on top of that.

### Main Focus of Improvment

 - I cannot publish easily today because AtomPub being very restricted on supported publishing tools. That's the main thing to improve
 - I am super unhappy with RavenDB. Let's get rid of that and make the peristance layer agnostic from the database engine so that I can swap it anytime I want.
 - Deployment is currently hard :s Let's strive for hosting this on Azure App Service and get rid of the server I have up and running for a while.
 - I want to have ads in the middle of posts. That would be amazing if I can get this done as well.
 - About page should be based on LinkedIn
