# Principals Around This Project

 - Being provider agnostic. This means that you can plug any supported providers for any part of the system such as hooking AWS S3 as your image storage system or Azure CosmosDB as your database system.
 - Easy to obtain and use. Main distribution mechanism for this blog engine will be through Docker and it will start working with defaults. With its extensible configuration mechanism, you can configure the bits and pieces as you go along.
