                🗣 I frequently participate at conferences as a speaker to talk about technical leadership, software architecture, lean 
                software development, Microsoft Azure and .NET.
            </p>

            <p>The biggest motivation for me to engage in public speaking is to learn more as I am big believer of learning by teaching. 
                I have also been benefiting from the openness of the software development community and 
                volunteering for public speaking is one of my ways of giving something back to show my appreciation and stay part of this great
                community 🙌
