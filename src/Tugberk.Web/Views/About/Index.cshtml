                I'm a self-motivated software guy who craves to create great software products and build effective development teams with 9 years of software development experience. I've been spreading my passion for software over the years through speaking at conferences, writing blog posts, establishing collaboration on open source projects, and authoring a book. All of these are the concrete evidences of how much I care about communicating whatâ€™s important, and what matters in software quality and software delivery process. I also aim to strive for the balance required to have a stable, maintainable and architecturally-accurate software product, and being on the market fast with an iterative approach.

                I currently work as a Technical Lead at Redgate by leading a team of 5 Software Engineers. I am responsible for all aspects of the products delivered by the team from technical architecture to product direction. I have been also a Microsoft MVP for more than 5 years on Microsoft development technologies.
