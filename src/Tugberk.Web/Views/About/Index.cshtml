                I'm a self-motivated Software Engineer who craves to create great software. I've been spreading my passion for software over the years through the talks I've given at conferences, blog posts I've written, the collaboration I've established on open source projects, and the book that I have authored. All of these are the concrete evidences of how much I care about communicating whatâ€™s important, and what matters in software quality and software delivery process. I'm also aware of the balance required to have a stable, maintainable and architecturally-accurate software product, and being on the market fast with an iterative approach.
